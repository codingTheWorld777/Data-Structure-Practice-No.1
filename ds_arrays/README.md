# Data structure 1: Array

## Summary about operation in array
- Insert an item from the forward of an array (O(n) running time complexity because of shifting another items in array, not include the first one)
- Insert an item from the backward of an array (O(1) running time complexity)
- Remove an item from the forward of an array (O(n) running time complexity such as inserting an item from the forward)
- Remove an item from the backward of an array (O(1) running time complexity such as removing an item from the backward)

## Some basic algorithm to deal with array
- Anagram
- Palindrome
- Reverse an array
- Reverse an array of integer
- Dutch National Flag (sort an array include 3 different integers)
- Trapping rain water
- Two pointers (classic algorithm)
